i386chat_server refactor branch.  
  
- [x] Base server   
- [x] PMs  
- [x] Nickname and Bio changes  
- [x] Rooms  
- [x] Moderation commands  
- [x] Text formatting  
- [x] User ignoring   
  
token-auth is unstable, and master is atrociously written. If you plan to use i386chat, please use this branch.
