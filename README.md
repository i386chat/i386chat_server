# 22 09 2022
I would like to actually come back to this again and rewrite it and fix all major issues it has, and then archive it.  
More publically accessible chat options is good, even if this is not perfect in any way.

Going to rewrite this again soon.  
    
- [x] Base server   
- [x] PMs  
- [x] Nickname and Bio changes  
- [x] Rooms  
- [x] Moderation commands  
- [x] Text formatting  
- [x] User ignoring   
  
token-auth is unstable, and master is atrociously written. If you plan to use i386chat, please use this branch.
